# Codename: Laki
Sylvia's Portfolio Site<br>
Framework: None. Fully Responsive HTML/CSS/Javascript Portfolio Site<br>

The simple minimalism achieved from this site took a lot of planning beforehand, which greatly influenced the copy, layouts, photos and interactivity.<br>


Worked on the following:<br>
* Wireframed each web page with UX in mind before implementing any code<br>
* Customized layout of each web page keeping mobile-friendly pixel resizing aspects in mind<br>
* Implementation of Greensock libraries<br>
* Open source fitvids.js integrated for responsive, cross-compatible resizing of videos (i.e desktop to mobile)<br>
* Custom logo design, resizing proportions for retina display devices (including both normal and inversed color shades)
* Custom and consistent CSS styling for media text, links, and buttons
* Adding Codepen's Pro feature animation embedding
* Photos fully optimized via Codekit for higher performance speed/less file size<br>
* Functioning contact form<br>
